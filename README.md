# Ransom Behavior Simulator

## Overview

The Ransom Behavior Simulator is a project aimed at creating a simulation of ransomware behavior using Python. This tool is designed to help users understand the mechanics of ransomware in a controlled environment, utilizing VirtualBox for safe execution.

## Features

- Simulates ransomware-like behavior in a safe environment.
- Utilizes VirtualBox for isolation and security.
- Written in Python, making it easy to modify and extend.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- VirtualBox

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raphaelmos/RansombehaviorSimulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RansombehaviorSimulator
   ```

## Usage

To run the simulator, execute the Python script:

```bash
python ransomtest.py
```

Ensure that you have a VirtualBox environment set up to safely conduct your tests.
